# learn-atom-hydrogen-octave

Atom is great - nice text editor  
Hydrogen is great - inline results, like iPython, but in my text editor. Very cool!  
Octave is great - easy syntax, great for prototyping  

Getting all of them to work together... slightly complicated. 

For my owner personal benifit, and now yours, I have put together instructs for getting them all to play nicely together.
